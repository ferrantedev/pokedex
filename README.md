## TrueLayer's Pokemon description resolver challenge

Obtain the pokemon's description in a Shakespearean style.

This service consumes the PokeApi `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/braixen/` 
endpoint and the shakespeare translate api `https://api.funtranslations.com/translate/shakespeare`
provided by Funtranslations. 

As Funtranslations api is rate limited, this api is backed by an in-memory 
cache. The cache eviction timeout is set at 1 minutes.
Nevertheless, if you encounter the following error, it means you've reached their limit.

```json 
{
    "status" : 429,
    "message" : "",
    "error" : "Too Many Requests",
    "timestamp" : "2020-11-04T10:11:19.862+00:00",
    "requestId" : "094970cd-3",
    "path" : "/pokemon/charizard"
 }
```
